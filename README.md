### Description

# SmartQuery | Reasoning-Driven AI Agent for SQL and Knowledge Retrieval

SmartQuery is an AI-powered agentic application designed to act not just as a translator of natural language into SQL, but as a true reasoning-driven data analyst. Unlike conventional AI agents that simply convert prompts into database queries, SmartQuery delivers intelig√™ncia com contexto: it reasons through user questions, decides what data sources to access, and dynamically combines structured (SQL) and unstructured (documents, PDFs, notes, strategy files) information to generate rich, contextual insights. This context-aware, multi-source reasoning makes it ideal for scenarios where knowledge lives not only in databases, but also in the documentation that surrounds them.

---

## üîç Overview

At its core, SmartQuery leverages:
- **Azure AI Agent Service** and OpenAI LLMs for natural language understanding
- **Reasoning workflows (ReAct)** for multi-step decision-making
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to enrich responses with document-based context
- **LangGraph** for agent orchestration and iterative thinking

It dynamically determines whether to:
- Run live SQL queries on user-provided PostgreSQL databases
- Retrieve semantic knowledge from user-uploaded documents (e.g., strategy files, PDFs, CSVs)
- Combine both sources into a unified, human-readable answer

---

## üß† What Makes it Agentic?
SmartQuery follows the **Reasoning + Acting (ReAct)** paradigm:

1. The agent reasons over the user‚Äôs question.
2. It determines the best action (SQL query, document lookup, or hybrid).
3. Executes the action, observes results.
4. Iterates until it produces a coherent, contextual response.

## üß© Data Model Overview

![Data Model](https://offgridmartech.com.br/ai-microsoft-hackathon/database_modelation.png)

This multi-tenant data model powers an AI-driven analytics platform where each user's data‚Äîsuch as connections, conversations, and documents‚Äîis securely isolated and linked to their `auth.users.id`.

### Key Tables Overview

#### `database_connections`
- Stores connection info for external SQL databases.
- Includes credentials and cached schema data.

#### `knowledge_sources`
- Manages unstructured files (e.g., planning docs, market reports).
- Includes metadata and indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

#### `conversations`
- Registers user-agent sessions.
- Tracks titles, thread IDs, and timestamps to preserve interaction context.

#### `messages`
- Logs individual chat messages.
- Includes roles and timestamps to enable complete conversational history.

#### `profiles`
- Extends user data with optional profile fields like name.
- Useful for personalization.

## üìä How It Works

1. **Connect to your database through the UI**  
   Easily select and connect your SQL data source in the interface.

   ![Conex√µes com Banco de Dados](https://offgridmartech.com.br/ai-microsoft-hackathon/database_conections.png)

2. **Upload unstructured sources for contextual retrieval**  
   Enrich the agent‚Äôs reasoning with supporting documents like PDFs, notes, and strategy files.

   ![Upload de Documentos](https://offgridmartech.com.br/ai-microsoft-hackathon/smart_query_upload_doc.png)

3. **Submit a natural language question via the UI**  
   Users can ask anything about the data ‚Äî the agent understands your intent and gets to work.

   ![Chat com o Agente](https://offgridmartech.com.br/ai-microsoft-hackathon/chat_with_database.png)

4. AI Agent routes the task using reasoning and actions
The agent determines the best course of action, whether it's executing SQL queries, retrieving information from vectorized documents or both.

5. **Data retrieval and reasoning**  
   The agent executes the appropriate actions: it runs SQL queries or accesses unstructured sources, then analyzes and refines the result.

6. **Response generation**  
   The final answer is returned directly in the chat interface, with full context.
