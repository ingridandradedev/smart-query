### Description

# SmartQuery | Reasoning-Driven AI Agent for SQL and Knowledge Retrieval

SmartQuery is an AI-powered agentic application designed to act not just as a translator of natural language into SQL, but as a true reasoning-driven data analyst. Unlike conventional AI agents that simply convert prompts into database queries, SmartQuery delivers inteligência com contexto: it reasons through user questions, decides what data sources to access, and dynamically combines structured (SQL) and unstructured (documents, PDFs, notes, strategy files) information to generate rich, contextual insights. This context-aware, multi-source reasoning makes it ideal for scenarios where knowledge lives not only in databases, but also in the documentation that surrounds them.

---

## 🔍 Overview

At its core, SmartQuery leverages:
- **Azure AI Agent Service** and OpenAI LLMs for natural language understanding
- **Reasoning workflows (ReAct)** for multi-step decision-making
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to enrich responses with document-based context
- **LangGraph** for agent orchestration and iterative thinking

It dynamically determines whether to:
- Run live SQL queries on user-provided PostgreSQL databases
- Retrieve semantic knowledge from user-uploaded documents (e.g., strategy files, PDFs, CSVs)
- Combine both sources into a unified, human-readable answer

---

## 🧠 What Makes it Agentic?
SmartQuery follows the **Reasoning + Acting (ReAct)** paradigm:

1. The agent reasons over the user’s question.
2. It determines the best action (SQL query, document lookup, or hybrid).
3. Executes the action, observes results.
4. Iterates until it produces a coherent, contextual response.

---

## 🚀 Use Cases
- Marketing teams exploring campaign performance metrics
- BI teams asking analytical questions without writing SQL
- Operations teams querying live databases and internal docs in one place

---

## 📊 Key Features
- ✅ Natural language chat interface powered by an AI agent
- 🔄 Multi-turn conversations with context retention
- 📁 Upload and manage documents (PDF, TXT, DOCX, CSV)
- 🧠 RAG pipeline with vector search (Pinecone or Supabase Vector)
- 👨‍💼 Multi-tenant: each user sees only their data, docs, and chats
- ⚡ Built with Python, Azure AI, Docker, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, LangGraph, Supabase

## ⚖️ API Endpoints

### `POST /invoke_last`
Processes user messages and returns the final agent response.

### `POST /stream`
Optional endpoint for real-time, streaming responses.

### `POST /load-data`
Uploads and indexes documents to the vector database.

### `GET /query-data`
Queries vectorized documents to retrieve context for the agent.

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Connect to your database through the UI**  
   Easily select and connect your SQL data source in the interface.

2. **Upload unstructured sources for contextual retrieval**  
   Enrich the agent’s reasoning with supporting documents like PDFs, notes, and strategy files.

3. **Submit a natural language question via the UI**  
   Users can ask anything about the data — the agent understands your intent and gets to work.

   ![Chat com o Agente](https://offgridmartech.com.br/ai-microsoft-hackathon/chat_with_database.png)

4. AI Agent routes the task using reasoning and actions
The agent determines the best course of action, whether it's executing SQL queries, retrieving information from vectorized documents or both.

5. **Data retrieval and reasoning**  
   The agent executes the appropriate actions: it runs SQL queries or accesses unstructured sources, then analyzes and refines the result.

6. **Response generation**  
   The final answer is returned directly in the chat interface, with full context.
